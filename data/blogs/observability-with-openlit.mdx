## Introduction:

In the world of GenAI projects, seamless observability is key to unlocking top-notch performance and reliability. Meet OpenLIT, the OpenTelemetry-native GenAI and LLM Application Observability tool that's set to revolutionise the way you monitor and optimize your applications. With just a single line of code, OpenLIT makes integrating observability into your GenAI projects as easy as pie. Let's dive into the world of OpenLIT and explore how it can enhance your application observability.

> Understanding LIT:
> LIT, short for Learning and Inference Tool, is a visual and interactive tool designed to provide insights into AI models and visualize data. Originally introduced by Google, LIT offers a user-friendly interface for understanding the inner workings of AI models and analyzing data effectively.

## Features that Make OpenLIT Stand Out

### Monitor LLM and VectorDB Performance

OpenLIT automatically generates traces and metrics, giving insights into your applicationâ€™s performance and costs. You can track performance in different environments and optimize resource use efficiently.

### Cost Tracking for Custom and Fine-Tuned Models

You can customize and track costs for specific AI models using OpenLITâ€™s custom JSON file. This helps in precise budgeting and aligning costs with your project needs.

## OpenTelemetry-native SDKs

OpenLIT supports OpenTelemetry natively, ensuring smooth integration without added complexity. Being vendor-neutral, it easily fits into your existing AI stack.

OTel Auto Instrumentation Capabilities
OpenLIT complies to the OpenTelemetry communityâ€™s Semantic Conventions and is updated on a regular basis to maintain alignment with the community. OpenLIT offers insights to improve the performance and stability of LLM applications, whether using popular hosted LLMs like OpenAI and HuggingFace, self-hosted LLMs like Ollama or GPT4All, or vector databases like ChromaDB and Pinecone.
